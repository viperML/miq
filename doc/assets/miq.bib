  abstract = {Dependency solving is a hard (NP-complete) problem in all non-trivial component models due to either mutually incompatible versions of the same packages or explicitly declared package conflicts. As such, software upgrade planning needs to rely on highly specialized dependency solvers, lest falling into pitfalls such as incompleteness - a combination of package versions that satisfy dependency constraints does exist, but the package manager is unable to find it. In this paper we look back at proposals from dependency solving research dating back a few years. Specifically, we review the idea of treating dependency solving as a separate concern in package manager implementations, relying on generic dependency solvers based on tried and tested techniques such as SAT solving, PBO, MILP, etc. By conducting a census of dependency solving capabilities in state-of-the-art package managers we conclude that some proposals are starting to take off (e.g., SAT-based dependency solving) while - with few exceptions - others have not (e.g., outsourcing dependency solving to reusable components). We reflect on why that has been the case and look at novel challenges for dependency solving that have emerged since.},

  abstract = {Circular dependencies between software artefacts are widely considered as problematic. However, empirical studies of Java programs have shown that most programs are riddled with circular dependencies. This seems to imply that not all circular dependencies are as detrimental to software quality as previously thought. Clearly, a better understanding of the types of circular dependency and their effect on software quality is required. In this paper, we provide precise definitions for different types of circular dependencies, analyse their topology and investigate the relationship between circular dependencies and the package containment tree. Our analysis is based on the popular Qualities Corpus data set. We find that in package dependency graphs, most circular dependencies are "package local": they are confined to branches of the package containment tree where they form around parent packages. Existing research indicates that these dependencies may not be critical. This may explain why circular dependencies are so common in widely-used real-world programs.},

  abstract = {Web developers can (and do) include subresources such as scripts, stylesheets and images in their webpages. Such subresources might be stored on content delivery networks (CDNs). This practice creates security and privacy risks, should a subresource be corrupted. The subresource integrity (SRI) recommendation, released in mid-2016 by the W3C, enables developers to include digests in their webpages in order for web browsers to verify the integrity of subresources before loading them. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale longitudinal study of the use of SRI on the Web by analyzing massive crawls (≈ 3B URLs) of the Web over the last 3.5 years. Our results show that the adoption of SRI is modest (≈), but grows at an increasing rate and is highly influenced by the practices of popular library developers (e.g., Bootstrap) and CDN operators (e.g., jsDelivr). We complement our analysis about SRI with a survey of web developers (N=): It shows that a substantial proportion of developers know SRI and understand its basic functioning, but most of them ignore important aspects of the recommendation. The results of the survey also show that the integration of SRI by developers is mostly manual – hence not scalable and error prone. This calls for a better integration of SRI in build tools.},

In particular, we devise an embedded domain-specific language (EDSL) to describe and compose packages. We demonstrate how it allows us to benefit from the host general-purpose programming language while not compromising on expressiveness. Second, we show the use of Scheme to write build programs, leading to "two-tier" programming system.}

Regardless of migration effort involved, developers are encouraged to maintain their library dependencies by updating any outdated dependency, so as to remain safe from potential threats such as vulnerabilities. Through a manual inspection of a total of 60 client projects from three cases of high severity vulnerabilities, we investigate whether or not clients are really safe from these threats. Surprisingly, our early results show evidence that up to 73.3\% of outdated clients were actually safe from the threat. This is the first work to confirm that analysis at the library level is indeed an overestimation. This result to pave the path for future studies to empirically investigate and validate this phenomena, and is towards aiding a smoother library migration for client developers.},

Scientific applications require specific versions of compilers, MPI, and other dependency libraries, so using a single, standard software stack is infeasible. However, managing many configurations is difficult because the configuration space is combinatorial in size. We introduce Spack, a tool used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to manage this complexity. Spack provides a novel, recursive specification syntax to invoke parametric builds of packages and dependencies. It allows any number of builds to coexist on the same system, and it ensures that installed packages can find their dependencies, regardless of the environment. We show through real-world use cases that Spack supports diverse and demanding applications, bringing order to HPC software chaos.},

  abstract = {Software reproducibility is important for re-usability and the cumulative progress of research. An important manifestation of unreproducible software is the changed outcome of software builds over time. While enhancing code reuse, the use of open-source dependency packages hosted on centralized repositories such as PyPI can have adverse effects on build reproducibility. Frequent updates to these packages often cause their latest versions to have breaking changes for applications using them. Large Python applications risk their historical builds becoming unreproducible due to the widespread usage of Python dependencies, and the lack of uniform practices for dependency version specification. Manually fixing dependency errors requires expensive developer time and effort, while automated approaches face challenges of parsing unstructured build logs, finding transitive dependencies, and exploring an exponential search space of dependency versions. In this paper, we investigate how open-source Python projects specify dependency versions, and how their reproducibility is impacted by dependency packages. We propose a tool PyDFix to detect and fix unreproducibility in Python builds caused by dependency errors. PyDFix is evaluated on two bug datasets BugSwarm and BugsInPy, both of which are built from real-world open-source projects. PyDFix analyzes a total of 2,702 builds, identifying 1,921 (71.1\%) of them to be unreproducible due to dependency errors. From these, PyDFix provides a complete fix for 859 (44.7\%) builds, and partial fixes for an additional 632 (32.9\%) builds.},

  abstract = {Speculative compiler optimizations are effective in improving both single-thread performance and reducing power consumption, but their implementation introduces significant complexity, which can limit their adoption, limit their optimization scope, and negatively impact the reliability of the compilers that implement them. To eliminate much of this complexity, as well as increase the effectiveness of these optimizations, we propose that microprocessors provide architecturally-visible hardware primitives for atomic execution. These primitives provide to the compiler the ability to optimize the program's hot path in isolation, allowing the use of non-speculative formulations of optimization passes to perform speculative optimizations. Atomic execution guarantees that if a speculation invariant does not hold, the speculative updates are discarded, the register state is restored, and control is transferred to a non-speculative version of the code, thereby relieving the compiler from the responsibility of generating compensation code.  We demonstrate the benefit of hardware atomicity in the context of a Java virtual machine. We find incorporating the notion of atomic regions into an existing compiler intermediate representation to be natural, requiring roughly 3,000 lines of code (\textasciitilde 3\% of a JVM's optimizing compiler), most of which were for region formation. Its incorporation creates new opportunities for existing optimization passes, as well as greatly simplifying the implementation of additional optimizations (e.g., partial inlining, partial loop unrolling, and speculative lock elision). These optimizations reduce dynamic instruction count by 11\% on average and result in a 10-15\% average speedup, relative to a baseline compiler with a similar degree of inlining.},

In addition, for secure execution there is a need for process isolation on a shared platform. Existing virtual machine and container technologies are often more complex than traditional Unix utilities, like chroot, and often require root privileges in order to set up or use. This is especially challenging on HPC systems where users typically do not have root access. We therefore present nsroot, a lightweight Linux namespaces based process isolation tool. It allows restricting the runtime environment of data analysis tools that may not have been designed with security as a top priority, in order to reduce the risk and consequences of security breaches, without requiring any special privileges. The codebase of nsroot is small, and it provides a command line interface similar to chroot. It can be used on all Linux kernels that implement user namespaces. In addition, we propose combining nsroot with the AppImage format for secure execution of packaged applications. nsroot is open sourced and available at: https://github.com/uit-no/nsroot}

  abstract = {This ebook is the first authorized digital version of Kernighan and Ritchie's 1988 classic, The C Programming Language (2nd Ed.). One of the best-selling programming books published in the last fifty years, "K\&R" has been called everything from the "bible" to "a landmark in computer science" and it has influenced generations of programmers. Available now for all leading ebook platforms, this concise and beautifully written text is a "must-have" reference for every serious programmers digital library.    As modestly described by the authors in the Preface to the First Edition, this "is not an introductory programming manual; it assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. Nonetheless, a novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language, although access to a more knowledgeable colleague will help."},

  abstract = {Lightweight virtualization (i.e., containers) offers a virtual host environment for applications without the need for a separate kernel, enabling better resource utilization and improved efficiency. However, the shared kernel also prevents containers from taking advantage of security features that are available to traditional VMs and hosts. Containers cannot apply local policies to govern integrity measurement, code execution, mandatory access control, etc. to prevent application-specific security problems. Changes have been proposed to make kernel security mechanisms available to containers, but such changes are often adhoc and expose the challenges of trusting containers to make security decisions without compromising host system or other containers. In this paper, we propose security namespaces, a kernel abstraction that enables containers to have an autonomous control over their security. The security namespace relaxes the global and mandatory assumption of kernel security frameworks, thus enabling containers to independently define security policies and apply them to a limited scope of processes. To preserve security, we propose a routing mechanism that can dynamically dispatch an operation to a set of containers whose security might be affected by the operation, therefore ensuring the security decision made by one container cannot compromise the host or other containers. We demonstrate security namespace by developing namespaces for integrity measurement and mandatory access control in the Linux kernel for use by Docker containers. Results show that security namespaces can effectively mitigate security problems within containers (e.g., malicious code execution) with less than 0.7\% additional latency to system call and almost identical application throughput. As a result, security namespaces enable containers to obtain autonomous control over their security without compromising the security of other containers or the host system.}
